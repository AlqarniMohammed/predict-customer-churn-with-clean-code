# Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity
- The rights to the data and files in this project are reserved to **Udacity**

## Project Description
This project is about identify the customer churn and create a model for
Predict customer churn, Then we move to implementing the engineering and
software best practices to have **lean Code Package** in the end

### Data description
We have a bank of data that describe the customers informations, every record present a costumer, and we used these data for predict the customer churn regarding his information.

## Running Files
First, You should to run *churn_library.py* and this will implement all functions in this file and create the models that can predict the customer churn.

Then you should to run *churn_script_logging_and_tests.py* and this will logging and testing all functions in the first file that we have run.
