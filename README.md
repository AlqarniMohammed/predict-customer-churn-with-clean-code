# Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity
- The rights to the data and files in this project are reserved to **Udacity**

## Project Description
This project is about identify the customer churn and create a model for
Predict customer churn, Then we move to implementing the engineering and
software best practices to have **Clean Code Package** in the end

We start from *churn_notebook.ipynb* and packaging all codes in *churn_library.py*, Then we logged 
and tested all functions in *churn_script_logging_and_tests.py*.

### What have we achieved in this project?
- Raise Code Quality
- implement Testing & Logging
- Save Images & Models
- Problem Solving

## Files and data description

### Data description
We have a bank of data that describe the customers informations, every record present a costumer, and we used these data for predict the customer churn regarding his information.
Unfortunately, you will not find the data included in the project to preserve Udacity's rights.

## Achieving PEP 8 standards
We achieved PEP 8 standards in both Python files with a score of +9.5 when using the Pylint tool
